# Slimey Jump - Rony Hanna 
A simple 2D Doodle Jump clone created with my own 2D engine using SDL and OpenGL. 

External dependencies used:  
- __Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)__  
- __OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (glew)__  
- __Freetype__: Used for text rendering  
- __OpenGL Mathematics__: Math header library  
- __FMOD__: Used for game audio  
- __Simple OpenGL Image Loader (SOIL)__: Used for loading texture images   

# About The Game
Slimey Jump is a platforming video game where the player has to guide a slime up a never-ending series of platforms without falling.

# Game Controls
Press the 'A' key to move left  
Press the 'D' Key to move right  
Press the 'H' key to use fullscreen mode

# Notes
The game is still very basic and gets pretty boring really fast, I will be adding enemies for the player to shoot at along with various 
different objects the player can acquire during the game (such as propeller hats and jetpacks) to move faster.   

You may play the game by navigating to the debug folder and double clicking the Slimey Jump.exe file.  
If you would rather run the game using VS then simply run the .sln file instead.   
If the project failed to load, please follow these simple steps below:  
 - Select the project in __Solution Explorer__
 - In __Properties Window__, click on the path and a browse button (__...__) will appear on the right
 - Click the browse button and locate project file __.vcsproj__ which is contained in the Slimey Jump folder and click open
 - Back in the Solution Explorer, simply __Reload Project__ and you should be good to go, enjoy!
 
 Also please ensure that your Visual Studio's solution platform is set to x86 instead of x64.
 
 Thank you very much for trying out Slimey Jump!
